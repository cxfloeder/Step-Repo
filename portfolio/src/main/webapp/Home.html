        <h2>Quick Bio</h2>
        <p>
            I was born March 4, 2001 in Minnesota. I am the 7th of 10 kids in
            my family. There are 7 boys and 3 girls. Because of that, there was
            always things going on at my house. Despite there not being much
            privacy or quietness, I love being part of a large family.

            Here are a few fun facts about me from my high school years. I went
            to Mounds View High School where I participated in several
            activities. I was the Captain of my school's Bowling Team and Men's
            Volleyball Team. Senior year, I was part of the Ball Squad (my
            schools table tennis team), and we placed 3rd in the state
            tournament. Despite being tall and skinny, I was on my school's
            wrestling team for 3 years. I also enjoyed being a drummer in my
            school's jazz band.

            I recently completed my Freshman year at the University of Nebraksa
            - Lincoln. I am part of a really cool honors program there called the
            Raikes School for Computer Science and Management. I am majoring in
            Computer Science and minoring in Business Management. I really
            enjoyed going to the sporting events, especially Volleyball because
            Nebraska has a really great team. I am also involved in the Newman
            Center at college.
