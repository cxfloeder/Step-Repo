      <h2>Quick Bio</h2>
      <p>
            I was born March 4, 2001 in Minnesota. I am the 7th of 10 kids in my family. 
            There are 7 boys and 3 girls. Because of that, there was always things going on at my house. While there may 
            not be much privacy or quietness, I love being part of a large family.

            Here are a few fun facts about me from my high school years. I went to Mounds View High School where I 
            participated in several activities. I was the Captian of my school's Bowling Team and Men's Volleyball Team. 
            Senior year, I was part of the Ball Squad (my schools table tennis team), and we placed 3rd in the state tournament. 
            Despite being tall and skinny, I was on my schools wrestling team for 3 years. I also enjoyed being a drummer in my 
            my school's jazz band.

            I recently completed my Freshman year at the University of Nebraksa-Lincoln. I am part of a really cool honors program
            there called the Raikes School for Computer Science and Management. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Management.
            I really enjoyed going to the sporting events, especially Volleyball because Nebraska has a really great team. I am also involved 
            in the Newman Center at college.
